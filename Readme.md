# Casechain

Casechain is a hash-chain that aims to safe all court verdicts in a hashed distributed system.
This project has no business case and is just a practical exercise.

Current status:
- hashing and hashchain are working properly
- data structures are implemented but not useful in a practical usecase
- distributed system works in local network
